# Java_Parallel_Computing
Parallel and Distributed Computing Project in Java. 

The projects are writen in Visual Studio.

Project 1 : Creates threads and executes parallel and Recursive calculatios.

Project 2 : Calculates the square root of the elements of a matrix and performs matrix multiplications using parallel threads.

Project 3 : Like the Project 2 using inner class for variable sharing.

Project 4 : Calculates Pi using parallel threads and locks so that the parallel threads execute their tasks serialized.

Project 5 : Creates a bank account and performs CRUD operations serialized with locks. The philosophers program presents a solution to break cyclic wait.

Project 6 : A program that finds and matches a given string in a text and a programm that computes a histogram of the occurance of letters in a text. 

Project 7 : Buffers and semaphores. Programes that imply buffers and semaphores to solve and break ties.

Java Parallel SMS Server : Creates an sms client server that receives processes and replies with sms.

Java Parallel Multithreaded Server : Creates and implies a multithreaded Server.
